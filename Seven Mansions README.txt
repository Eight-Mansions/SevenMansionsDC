Seven Mansions: Ghastly Smile (Nanatsu no Hikan: Senritsu no Bishou) English Translation v1.3 (December 2020)

# Patch Notes #
v1.4
*  Adds VGA support thanks to TapamN and derek (ateam)!

Game is fully translated, with v1.3 adding the following:
*  Newly rendered videos with improved audio and uncompressed GDI version as an option
*  VMU translations
*  Memory card error translations
*  Vastly improved text highlighting code, so highlights should be much more reliable
*  Previously unlocalized puzzles are now localized for English speakers
*  Several typos and grammatical issues addressed
*  Alpha transparency issues on the map screen resolved
*  Options menu no longer has a ghosting gray box
*  Fixed the game thinking it was Sengoku TURB (who could blame it?)

Game runs as expected on original Dreamcast hardware. To play on stock hardware, burn the compressed cutscenes to a disc and insert the disc into your Dreamcast as normal. The uncompressed cutscenes can be used if you aren't limited by file size.

# Installation #
Only the translated files are included, so you will need an existing copy of Seven Mansions. Any version should be fine, including the earlier English translation.

1. Extract your files using your favorite program that can read your CDI/GDI image (CDMage, Isobuster, GD-ROM Explorer, etc).

2. Copy the translated patch files into your extracted game folder. Overwrite any existing files.

3. Repackage the game using your preferred tool, such as BootDreams or Lazy Boot.

# BootDreams #
1. Select "DiscJuggler," then under "Selfboot folder," browse for your extracted folder.
2. Click Process. Click "Yes" to confirm making a DiscJuggler image. Click "No" if it asks you to scramble the main binary.
3. Select your output directory and file name.

# LazyBoot #
1. Drag the patched game files into LazyBoot's "data" directory.
2. Click "fast-mode-lazy.cmd" if you want the default options, otherwise start "lazyboot_v3.0.cmd" to customize your output.
